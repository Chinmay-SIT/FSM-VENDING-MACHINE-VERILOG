# FSM-VENDING-MACHINE-VERILOG
This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM)-based vending machine using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The system accepts predefined cash denominations, supports extra cash handling, and dispenses one of three products. It is verified through a testbench with multiple transaction scenarios.
